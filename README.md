## 🔥 Top Findings (Selected)

1. **[SOLO][Contest] Share Manipulation via Liquidity Inflation Attack in Position Tokenization**  
   ↳ [View Finding](https://cantina.xyz/code/8cf9c7a0-a7a6-446a-8577-1e2c254eb5a8/findings/58)  
   Description: Position tokenization can be exploited by inflating underlying liquidity via directly interacting with the underlying protocol(Uniswap V3), stealing new users’ contributions.

2. **[SOLO][Contest] Reward Rate Manipulation via Short Extension of Rewards Interval**  
   ↳ [View Finding](https://cantina.xyz/code/fadb5a8f-e39c-4a6b-89f6-a03858bb8602/findings/459)  
   Description: A campaign's reward rate can be manipulated near the end by extending the reward interval, causing financial harm.


3. **[Contest] Hash Collision Vulnerability in Token Bit Position Mapping**  
   ↳ [View Finding](https://cantina.xyz/code/8cf9c7a0-a7a6-446a-8577-1e2c254eb5a8/findings/41)  
   Description: Modulo-based token mapping can cause hash collisions, leading to incorrect token tracking and system malfunction.

4. **[Contest] Lack of Check If IP Can Award Point — Fake Order Creation**  
   ↳ [View Finding](https://cantina.xyz/code/fadb5a8f-e39c-4a6b-89f6-a03858bb8602/findings/527)  
   Description: Missing IP authorization check allows fake order creation, disrupting protocol operation.

5. **[SOLO][Contest] Lender Loss on Quick Loan Repayment**  
   ↳ [View Finding](https://cantina.xyz/code/c2e31b04-fbb2-4355-80ef-141d58b6e0cc/findings/17)  
   Description: No minimum repayment time can cause lenders to incur losses if the borrower repays too quickly, potentially harming lender funds.


6. **[Contest] Missing Signature Expiration Control in Implementation Setting**  
   ↳ [View Finding](https://cantina.xyz/code/b0a948cd-c861-4807-b36e-d680d82598bf/findings/96)  
   Description: Implementation signatures lack expiration, allowing old signatures to remain executable indefinitely.
